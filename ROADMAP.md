# Ideas for future improvements

- [x] take current color into account when determining the point when to switch text from light to dark
- [ ] add flake.nix file with package definition
- [ ] rotate the color wheel in larger steps (e.g, when shift is pressed)
- [ ] Transparency slider
- [ ] Optional slider for color (vs. color only avalilable in the "wheel" shape)
- [ ] support different (wider gammut) color model (OKLH, HSL, color names etc.)
- [ ] support for parsing colors other than 3-byte hex in the c flag
- [ ] integrate with chatGPT for parsing arbitrary text and interprete it as a color (--prompt?)
